Welcome to my GitHub Page. I am Hyeong Kyun (Daniel) Park, currently a CS Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University. I also graduated from Purdue University with a Joint M.S. in CS + Stat (2026), and B.S. Computer Science, Data Science, Applied Statistics, and a Math minor (2022).

I love software development, AI, and academia-industry collaborations.
